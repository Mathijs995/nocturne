    "\n",
    "Nocturne is a 2D, partially observed, driving simulator, built in C++ for speed and exported as a Python library. It is currently designed to handle traffic scenarios from the [Waymo Open Dataset](https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset), a large-scale public dataset for autonomous driving research, released by Waymo. \n",
    "\n",
    "The package is currently optimized for working with the Waymo Open Dataset and its data structure. However, with some modifications, nocturne could be extended to support different driving datasets.\n"
